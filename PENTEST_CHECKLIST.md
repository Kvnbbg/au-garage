# Pentest Checklist: OWASP Top 10 Anchoring (2021 & 2025)

This checklist anchors a “Top 20 developer mistakes” mental model to the current OWASP taxonomy so findings are actionable, reportable, and consistent with modern risk classifications.

## OWASP Top 10 Mapping Reference

- **A03** Injection
- **A04** Insecure Design
- **A05** Security Misconfiguration
- **A06** Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **A07** Identification & Authentication Failures
- **A08** Software & Data Integrity Failures

### OWASP Top 10:2025 (latest OWASP site structure)
- **A01** Broken Access Control
- **A02** Security Misconfiguration

> **Operational note:** A modern report should explicitly call out supply chain exposure and exception handling when relevant.

## “Top 20 developer mistakes” as a pentest checklist

For each item, capture the **signal** (evidence) and map it to the **OWASP risk** category most applicable to the observed behavior.

1. **Permitting invalid data into the database**
   - **Pentest signal:** missing server-side validation; inconsistent states; error messages; odd edge-case behavior.
   - **Maps to:** Injection / Insecure Design / Security Misconfiguration (depending on symptom).

2. **Focusing on the system as a whole (instead of trust boundaries)**
   - **Pentest signal:** authorization assumed “somewhere else”; missing checks at object/action level; microservice-to-microservice trust.
   - **Maps to:** Broken Access Control / Insecure Design.

3. **Personally developed security methods (“homegrown crypto/auth”)**
   - **Pentest signal:** bespoke token formats, nonstandard signing/encryption, ad-hoc password hashing.
   - **Maps to:** Cryptographic Failures / Authentication Failures.

4. **Treating security as the last step**
   - **Pentest signal:** systemic issues across modules; repeated patterns; no consistent controls.
   - **Maps to:** Insecure Design.

5. **Plain-text password storage**
   - **Pentest signal:** breach impact becomes catastrophic; password reuse cascade.
   - **Maps to:** Cryptographic Failures / Authentication Failures.

6. **Weak passwords**
   - **Pentest signal:** account takeover via credential stuffing/password spraying (if in scope), weak policy, weak reset flows.
   - **Maps to:** Authentication Failures.

7. **Storing unencrypted data in the database**
   - **Pentest signal:** PII/secrets visible at rest; backups/exports leak; over-privileged reads.
   - **Maps to:** Cryptographic Failures.

8. **Depending excessively on the client side**
   - **Pentest signal:** “disabled button” security; client-side role flags; hidden fields deciding price/role.
   - **Maps to:** Broken Access Control / Insecure Design.

9. **Being too optimistic (“users won’t do that”)**
   - **Pentest signal:** missing abuse-case design; no rate limits; predictable identifiers; weak anti-automation.
   - **Maps to:** Insecure Design / Authentication Failures.

10. **Permitting variables via the URL path name**
    - **Pentest signal:** IDOR/BOLA patterns; object IDs swapped; path-based authorization missing.
    - **Maps to:** Broken Access Control.

11. **Trusting third-party code**
    - **Pentest signal:** vulnerable dependencies; risky plugins; supply-chain exposure; weak update governance.
    - **Maps to:** Vulnerable/Outdated Components (2021) and **Software Supply Chain Failures** (2025).

12. **Hard-coding backdoor accounts**
    - **Pentest signal:** undocumented privileged users; default creds; “support” accounts; hidden admin routes.
    - **Maps to:** Authentication Failures / Broken Access Control.

13. **Unverified SQL injections (more broadly: “unverified injections”)**
    - **Pentest signal:** injection sinks in query/filters/search; inconsistent output; server errors; data-dependent behavior.
    - **Maps to:** Injection.

14. **Remote file inclusions (RFI)**
    - **Pentest signal:** dynamic include of remote resources; template/include parameters; risky interpreters.
    - **Maps to:** Injection / Security Misconfiguration (often both).

15. **Insecure data handling (logs, exports, debug dumps)**
    - **Pentest signal:** secrets in logs; verbose errors; PII in URLs; unsafe data sharing across tenants.
    - **Maps to:** Security Misconfiguration / Logging failures / Broken Access Control.

16. **Failing to encrypt data properly**
    - **Pentest signal:** weak modes, wrong key management, TLS gaps, broken at-rest protection.
    - **Maps to:** Cryptographic Failures.

17. **Not using a secure cryptographic system (again: “homegrown”)**
    - **Pentest signal:** nonstandard primitives, poor entropy, bad key rotation.
    - **Maps to:** Cryptographic Failures.

18. **Ignoring layer 8 (people/process)**
    - **Pentest signal:** weak operational controls, poor secrets hygiene, risky admin workflows, social engineering exposure (if in scope).
    - **Maps to:** often shows up as Misconfiguration / Authentication Failures / Logging failures.

19. **Failing to log, monitor, and alert on user actions**
    - **Pentest signal:** no audit trails; no alerting on sensitive operations; no traceability for abuse.
    - **Maps to:** Security Logging & Monitoring Failures (2021) / Logging & Alerting Failures (2025).

20. **WAF misconfigurations**
    - **Pentest signal:** false sense of security; bypassable rules; blocks normal traffic; breaks APIs; inconsistent enforcement.
    - **Maps to:** Security Misconfiguration (and sometimes **Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** in 2025).

## Black-box workflow to produce actionable findings

1. **Surface mapping**: Identify auth boundaries, roles, tenant model, and “high-value actions” (money, data export, admin).
2. **Abuse-case testing**: Per action, test “same user / different user / no auth / lower role” patterns (this flushes most access control failures).
3. **Input handling**: Test each input class (path, query, body, headers, file upload, template/lang selectors) against injection, file inclusion, SSRF-like fetches, and deserialization-like behaviors.
4. **Observability**: Verify what gets logged, what alerts, and whether sensitive ops are attributable (user/action/object/time).

## Reporting tips

- Always tie evidence to a specific OWASP category.
- Provide reproduction steps and concrete impact (data exposure, privilege escalation, integrity/availability loss).
- Recommend a short-term mitigation and a long-term control.
