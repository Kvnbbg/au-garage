## Disclosure Policy

Our goal is to balance transparency with responsible disclosure to protect our users. Hereâ€™s how we handle public disclosure:

1. **Internal Review:** Upon receiving a valid report, we conduct an internal review to assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
2. **Patch Development:** We develop and test a fix for the issue.
3. **Coordinated Release:** Once the fix is ready, we coordinate its release with the reporter (if applicable) to ensure proper communication.
4. **Public Announcement:** After the fix is deployed, we may publish a security advisory detailing the issue, its resolution, and credits to the reporter (with their permission).
