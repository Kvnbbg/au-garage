## Project Origin

Garage V. Parrot, founded by Vincent Parrot in Toulouse, specializes in comprehensive automobile services including repairs, maintenance, and the sale of pre-owned vehicles. In today's digital age, a robust online presence is vital. Our platform reflects the excellence and reliability of our services while incorporating innovative features and a futuristic twist.
A local mechanic, this project was designed as a hands-on demonstration for my studies at STUDI, the online French web developer school. It served as a practical exercise to showcase modern web development skills.

## Project Evolution

What started as a local project for Vincent Parrot has now transformed into a evolved story: An another entrepreneur acquires the garage and modernizes its operations with more technology and a broader range in the new era of web development.
