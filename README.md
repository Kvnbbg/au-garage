# Garage Web Application

## Introduction

Initially, this project was for Monsieur Parrot to be successful on the exam day at STUDI (my online web developer school between 2022-24). But now this project has evolved with the VR headset and more cars like Tesla.

## Overview

Garage V. Parrot, founded by Vincent Parrot in Toulouse, specializes in providing comprehensive automobile services including repairs, maintenance, and sales of pre-owned vehicles. In today’s digital age, establishing a robust online presence is crucial. Hence, we are committed to launching a web platform that mirrors the excellence and dependability of our services.
