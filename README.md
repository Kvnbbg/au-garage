## Introduction/Overview
Garage V. Parrot is a web application designed to modernize operations for automotive service providers. Originally created for Vincent Parrot of Toulouse, this platform now serves as a scalable solution for garage management. It combines service tracking, customer engagement, and inventory control, all presented through a role-based UI and dashboard system tailored to different user needs (Admin, Maintenance, Worker, Client).

## Background  
### Project Origin  
![Logo](https://github.com/Kvnbbg/au-garage/blob/main/app/static/images/logo.png)  
Developed as a capstone project during studies at [STUDI](https://studi.com) (2022â€“2024), this system was designed to digitize workflows for small automotive businesses. The platform emphasizes reliability, user experience, and adaptability to evolving industry demands.  

### Evolution  
The application has transitioned from a local garage tool to a modular solution for modern entrepreneurs, incorporating advanced features like VR integrations and predictive analytics.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Service Management**: Track repairs, maintenance, and vehicle sales.  
- **Inventory Control**: Real-time stock alerts and automated reordering.  
- **Customer Portal**: Direct communication, appointment booking, and invoice generation.  
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Distinct UIs and permissions for Admin, Maintenance, Worker, and Client roles.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Performance metrics and reporting tools.
- **Database-backed Visit Tracking**: Monitors user visits with a leaderboard display.
- **Configurable Maintenance Mode**: Allows administrators to display a maintenance notice with a specific start date.
- **Visual Login Indicator**: Provides clear visual feedback on login status.
- **Security Features**: Includes rate limiting to prevent abuse and CSRF protection on forms.

---

## Technical Overview / Architecture
### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python, utilizing the Flask framework with an object-oriented design.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is the target for production, with SQLite often used for development. Interactions are managed via Flask-Migrate and SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 for server-side templating, delivering a responsive UI (assumed to be styled with Bootstrap or a similar framework).
- **Integrations**: SMTP for email notifications, potential for payment gateways, and VR tools.

### Key Libraries & Extensions
- **Flask-Login**: Manages user sessions and authentication.
- **Flask-WTF**: Handles form creation, validation, and CSRF protection.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Provides ORM capabilities for database interaction.
- **Flask-Migrate**: Manages database schema migrations.
- **Flask-Limiter**: Implements rate limiting for application routes.
- **Flask-Mail**: Facilitates sending emails for notifications and password resets.

### Code Standards  
- Modular, reusable components.  
- Comprehensive error handling and logging.  
- RESTful API structure where applicable.

## Setup & Deployment  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (Python package installer)
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development)

### Installation Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kvnbbg/au-garage
    cd au-garage
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/macOS
    # For Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up the database:**
    Apply database migrations (creates tables if they don't exist):
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```
5.  **Initialize roles:**
    Populate the database with predefined user roles:
    ```bash
    flask init-roles
    ```
6.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with necessary configurations. See the Configuration section below for details.
7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```env
# Core Flask settings
SECRET_KEY='your_very_secret_key_here'  # Replace with a strong random key
FLASK_ENV='development' # or 'production'

# Database settings
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname' # For PostgreSQL
# Example for SQLite (development):
# DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///../instance/app.db'

# Email settings (using Flask-Mail)
MAIL_SERVER='smtp.example.com'
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME='your-email@example.com'
MAIL_PASSWORD='your-email-password'
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER='noreply@example.com'

# Application-specific settings
MAINTENANCE_START_DATE='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' # Optional: For maintenance mode display
```
**Note:** Ensure the `instance` folder exists if using SQLite, or that your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.

## Running with Docker

This project includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files to facilitate running the application and its PostgreSQL database in Docker containers. This is recommended for a consistent development and testing environment.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running on your system.
- Docker Compose installed (usually comes with Docker Desktop).

### Setup
1.  **Environment File:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the `.env.example` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Review and update the variables in `.env` as needed. Key variables for Docker include:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: Set a strong unique secret.
    - `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`: These will be used to initialize the PostgreSQL container. The `DATABASE_URL` in `docker-compose.yml` is configured to use these.
    - `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` for development mode with live reloading. For production-like testing, you might set it to `production`.

### Building and Running
1.  **Build the Docker images and start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d # The -d flag runs containers in detached mode
    ```
    The first time you run this, Docker will download the base images and build your application image, which might take a few minutes.

2.  **Accessing the Application:**
    Once the containers are up, the Flask application should be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your web browser.

3.  **Database Setup (First Run):**
    The first time you start the services, you'll need to set up the database schema and initial roles within the running `web` container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade
    docker-compose exec web flask init-roles
    ```

### Managing Services
-   **View Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f web  # For the web app
    docker-compose logs -f db   # For the database
    ```
-   **Stop Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
-   **Stop and Remove Volumes (e.g., to reset the database):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

### Running Flask CLI Commands
To run any `flask` CLI commands (like migrations, custom commands, etc.) within the context of the running `web` container:
```bash
docker-compose exec web <your_flask_command>
```
For example:
```bash
docker-compose exec web flask db migrate -m "new_migration"
docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade
docker-compose exec web flask init-roles
```
This is how you should attempt to run `flask db migrate` if you were previously facing issues in your local environment.

### Production Notes
- The default `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are configured for development (e.g., Flask development server, live reloading).
- For production, you would typically:
  - Set `FLASK_ENV=production` in your `.env` file.
  - Modify the `command` in `docker-compose.yml` for the `web` service to use a production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn (an example is commented out in the file).
  - Handle secrets more securely than just an `.env` file (e.g., using Docker secrets or other secrets management tools).
  - Ensure robust logging and monitoring.
  - Consider not mounting the application code as a volume for production images to ensure immutability, instead relying on the `COPY` instruction in the `Dockerfile`.

## Testing
The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

### Running Tests
To discover and run all tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and use the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
This will automatically find and execute all test cases located in the `tests` directory.
